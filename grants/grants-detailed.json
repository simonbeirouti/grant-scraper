The NATSIFAC Program service provider must ensure care services are provided within their allocated funding budget and any money from the conduct of the activity, including care recipient contributions. The renewal of NATSIFAC Program grant agreements is not an expansion opportunity.

      "Eligibility": "To be eligible, you must be one of the listed organisations in Section 4.1. The list of eligible organisations was determined as these organisations have demonstrated that they have the capacity to successfully deliver culturally safe aged care services to older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people under the NATSIFAC Program. Evidence of this is demonstrated through Aged Care Quality and Safety audit reports, annual financial acquittals and six-monthly Performance Reports in accordance with the grant agreement. The NATSIFAC Program is long standing direct service delivery program. All current providers (grantees) are well established, have established relationships and strong connections in the community they deliver services, and operate in thin markets where there are no alternate options for the provision of these services. Targeting Stream One organisations ensures that culturally safe aged services for older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, can continue to be delivered uninterrupted, particularly in remote and very remote areas of Australia. This also ensures stable funding and consistency for organisations operating in thin markets. Stream Two grant opportunities arise by invitation only. Organisations identified under Stream Two will seek to expand the reach of activities to further support older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across Australia.",

There are two streams of funding available, Job Creation – to fund the cost of wages and related entitlements, and the Community Jobs and Business Fund (CJBF) – to provide funding for equipment, operational costs and infrastructure to directly support bringing jobs created under the Job Creation stream into existence. For the purpose of the RJED program, a new job is: a job which does not already exist within an organisation and does not displace an existing employee, or a job created under the NJPT or CDP Trials. As job allocations are based on NIAA regions, you will need submit a separate application for each NIAA region where you intend to deliver a job. For example: If you apply for jobs located in more than one RES region, but all those jobs are in the same NIAA region, you will only need to submit one application for those jobs. If you apply for jobs located in more than one RES region, and those jobs are in different NIAA regions, you will need to submit a separate application for the jobs in each NIAA region.

      "Description": "The 2024 Clinical Trial Enabling Infrastructure grant opportunity focuses on promoting development and implementation of ‘adaptive platform’ and ‘registry based’ clinical trials which are thought to offer more efficient evaluation of potential medical therapies over conventional trial designs. This grant opportunity will provide grants of financial assistance across three streams, to support Australian medical research and medical innovation projects that: Stream 1: address an area of unmet medical need by promoting the development and implementation of adaptive platform trials. Funding under Stream 1 is available as follows: Topic A (Incubator): conducting inception projects that build evidence and capability to demonstrate the feasibility of establishing a national adaptive platform trial that would allow for rapid assessment of pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological interventions in an area of unmet need (up to $300,000). Topic B (Targeted Call for Research): establishing a new national adaptive platform trial that addresses an area of unmet need, including set up of central infrastructure and conduct of initial launch domains (up to $5,000,000). Topic C (Targeted Call for Research): expanding an existing adaptive platform trial by adding new domains that address an area of unmet need (up to $3,000,000). Stream 2 (Targeted Call for Research): conduct a registry-based randomised controlled trial in an area of unmet medical need by embedding a registry-based randomised controlled trial into a pre-existing clinical registry (up to $1,500,000). Stream 3 (Targeted Call for Research): establish a new clinical trial practice network or extend an existing clinical trial practice network to consolidate and strengthen sector capability in clinical trials and collaboration, with the aim of embedding evidence-based care in the health system and improving health outcomes, in an area of unmet medical need (up to $7,000,000).",
