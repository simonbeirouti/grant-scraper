If you registered an eligible vehicle between 1 September 2021 and 14 August 2022, you were able to claim back the stamp duty paid. The rebate was automatically applied from 15 August 2022 onwards. Important changes from 1 January 2024 The stamp duty exemption ended on 31 December 2023. Individuals and businesses that purchased or placed a deposit on an eligible EV prior to 1 January 2024 will still be eligible to receive the stamp duty exemption, regardless of whether the vehicle had been delivered by that date. This ensures that purchasers who were unable to register their vehicle by 31 December 2023 are not disadvantaged for delays in delivery. The automatically applied exemption on registration ended on 31 December 2023. Applications for stamp duty refunds for eligible EVs must be lodged from 1 January 2024. All new or used light BEVs and FCEVs with a dutiable value up to and including $78,000 were exempt from stamp duty. Any NSW resident or business registering or purchasing these vehicles between 1 September 2021 and 31 December 2023 for personal or business use were exempt from stamp duty on that registration. Applications lodged from 1 January 2024 will require proof of purchase (i.e. a contract to purchase) and deposit payment (where applicable), to indicate that the purchase or deposit payment was made prior to 1 January 2024.",
