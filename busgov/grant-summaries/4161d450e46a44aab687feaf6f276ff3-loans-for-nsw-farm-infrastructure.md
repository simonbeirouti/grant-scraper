# Loans for NSW farm infrastructure
  
## Program
Drought Infrastructure Fund NSW

## Summary
The Drought Infrastructure Fund NSW offers loans of up to $1 million to NSW farmers for capital works that provide long-term benefits and help mitigate adverse seasonal conditions. Eligible applicants must own or operate a farm in NSW, derive at least 50% of their income from farming, be registered as a primary producer with an ABN, and demonstrate the project's sustainability and ability to repay the loan.

## Application Complexity
**Medium**

## Key Tip
Applicants should clearly articulate how their proposed works align with each of the four main categories (drought preparedness, environment/soil conservation, farm infrastructure, natural resources) and provide detailed evidence of the long-term benefits and sustainability of their project. Consulting with financial advisors to strengthen the financial viability section can also improve chances of success.
