## Summary
The Graphite Research and Development Grant offers matched funding of between $10,000 and $50,000 for Australian SMEs collaborating with CSIRO on innovative R&D projects focused on natural graphite production, particularly for battery applications. Eligible applicants must be registered SMEs with an ABN and ACN, GST registration, and fewer than 200 employees. The grant aims to support sustainable graphite industry development in Australia.

## Application Complexity
**Medium**

## Key Tip
Applicants should clearly articulate how their R&D project aligns with the grant's objectives, especially in battery applications and sustainability. They should outline a detailed collaboration plan with CSIRO, including the expertise and resources they bring, and provide a strong justification for matching funds to demonstrate financial feasibility.
